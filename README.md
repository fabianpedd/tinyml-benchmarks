# TinyML Benchmarks
While the TinyML benchmarks from [MLPerf](https://github.com/mlcommons/tiny) are great, I found them verbose and hard to use for my projects. Thus, I assembled this collection of ready-to-go and easy-to-use benchmarks. They are based on the quantized models from the MLPerf TinyML benchmarks. However, they are completely self-contained and have no external dependencies. The code for running them using [TensorFlow Lite Micro](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro) is less than 100 lines. All data files are automatically generated using a couple of Python scripts that can be found in my [fork](https://github.com/fabianpedd/tiny) of the TinyML benchmarks MLPerf repo. Please refer to the `tinyml-benchmarks/` directory inside of that repo for more info.

Furthermore, these benchmarks are intended not only to give feedback on performance but also on functionality. Thus, they can be used to verify the correctness of the underlying kernel implementation.

Currently, I have generated 25 samples for every model. However, I can generate upwards of 1000 samples using the provided Python scripts.

**Disclaimer: These benchmarks are obviously of little use as they are! They are intended to be used as a baseline for integration into a larger project!**

## Benchmarks
This repository contains the four core benchmarks from the TinyML MLPerfâ„¢ benchmark suite:
- [`/benchmarks/aww`](/benchmarks/aww) Audio wake word - Keyword spotting using a depthwise separable convolutional neural network (DS-CNN)
- [`/benchmarks/ic`](/benchmarks/ic) Image classification - Small image classification using the Cifar10 dataset and a ResNet model architecture
- [`/benchmarks/toy`](/benchmarks/toy) ToyCar anomaly detection - Detecting anomalies in machine operating sounds using a deep autoencoder
- [`/benchmarks/vww`](/benchmarks/vww) Visual wake words - Image classification based on the presence of people using a MobileNet architecture

## TensorFlow Lite Micro Source Tree
The TensorFlow Lite Micro directories are generated from the [TensorFlow Lite Micro](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro) repo using:  
`python3 tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/project_generation/create_tflm_tree.py ./tree`  
In order to generate the source tree with specialized (CMSIS-NN) kernels, use:  
`python3 tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/project_generation/create_tflm_tree.py ./tree-cmsisnn --makefile_options=OPTIMIZED_KERNEL_DIR=cmsis_nn`  
Then simply copy the `tensorflow/` and `third_party/` directories over.  

Since using `glob` in CMake is not popular, one can instead use `find . -regex '.*/.*\.\(c\|cc\|cpp\|h\|hpp\)$'` to "manually" create a list of sources.
